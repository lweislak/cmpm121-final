# Devlog Entry - 11/20/24

Introducing the Team
--------------------------------------------
Tools Lead: Victoria Morgan,
Engine Lead: Lo Weislak,
Design Lead: Victoria Morgan

Tools and Materials
--------------------------------------------
Our team will be using TypeScript + HTML5 for the final game. It was recommended to switch from our original platform choice, Unity.
We both have knowledge of using GitHub for version control.

Visual Studio will be the primary IDE.

We will be utilizing free, premade assets. We may use a tile editor such as Tiled.

Phaser is our alternate engine choice.

Outlook
--------------------------------------------
Our team is hoping to implement particle effects when sowing and reaping plants to add more "juice" to the game.

The visual design is going to be the most difficult part of the project. This includes making the visuals look cohesive.

We hope to gain more knowledge about implementing game systems on a short time frame.
We don't have to come up with the premise, so it'll be a good test of how to make a game based on given guidelines.
