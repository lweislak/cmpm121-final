Player moves in the four cardinal directions: WASD or arrow movement

Player can reap plants to remove them from the board, or sow one of
the three different types.

Player must be next to plants to reap or sow
(including diagonal movement, perhaps? Or just right in front of them?)

Every X steps, time moves forward. When time moves forward, sun tiles
and water tiles are randomly generated. Sun and Water are provided
to plants on those tiles.

Sun is temporary for the turn, water is added to a water value.
Water decreases when time moves forward.

(Possible cloud mechanic, lower sun but higher water? Creeps about
the board slowly, letting the player plant water-loving plants ahead
of them and sun-loving plants behind them)

Plants die when conditions are not right, and must be sowed.
They must be harvested when ripe to win the game.

Three types of plants: Wheat, Beans, and Potatoes

Wheat grows well with lots of sun, and next to wheat and potatoes.

Beans grow well with lots of water, and next to wheat.

Potatoes grow well with lots of water, and next to beans.

Effectiveness of other plants is increased at higher growth levels
E.g. Beans grow better next to wheat with a higher growth level than
a newly planted one (multiply by growth level?)

Arranging these three plants next to each other is successful to grow them

When time progresses and there are enough spare resources, plant grows
to the next level

Plants at level three give ingredients when reaped
Filling all three quotas (wheat, beans, potatoes) wins the game

If plants don't have enough resources, they wither.
Withered plants reduce the growth of plants around them.
(/actively hampers them by removing resources until they also die)
This causes a cascade event if all the plants are too close together

Ingredient levels don't decay over time, so losing entire garden does not
remove progress forward (but withered plants must be cleared before new
plants may be planted)
